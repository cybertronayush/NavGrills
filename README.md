This is Project from Navigus Hiring Assesment.
In the this assignment, we are going to build an adaptive learning platform, leveraging gamification to engage users. There are two types of user roles in this application: ● Teachers ● Students A teacher is supposed to add, remove, edit, and delete courses. For each course, they will be able to create one quiz only, based on a set of questions and their respective answers (Choice-based Questions only). Teachers should also be able to add/edit/delete questions and answers to a quiz for a course.
